== PROJECT: ɯeme

---

== Overview

ɯeme is a meme manager app for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing memes*. More importantly, ɯeme is optimized for those who *prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users can view, tag, search, import and export a collection of meme. They can also create their own memes from meme templates.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to suggest and auto-complete commands*
** What it does: allows the user to type command faster and easier by showing possible command arguments and allow the user to use TAB key to auto-complete the command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can be tired of typing the full command over and over again, or unsure of what arguments to supply.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it requires live update of input and different methods to process different commands in order to generate suggestions.
** Credits: `LevenshteinDistance` in `org.apache.commons.text` is used in calculating the similarity between strings.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** Refactored `commands` and `parser` packages by grouping files into sub-packages according to the type of commands. [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-3/main/pull/114[#114]]
